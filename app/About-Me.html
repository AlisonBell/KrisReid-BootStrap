					<h2>The Early Years</h2>
						<p class="aboutMeText">
							I grew up in a suburb of Bristol with my mum, dad and two brothers.  My first love, at age six, was football and I played for my local club loyally every Saturday / Sunday until I moved away from Bristol.
							<br />
							<br />
							As the youngest child I spent most of my youth doing whatever my big brotherâ€™s did including taking up the trumpet (I even made the band) and spending many a day playing FIFA on the Xbox.
							<br />
							<br />
							I was convinced that I was going to be the best centre half Barcelona had ever signed but my high school tutors at Gordano encouraged me to work hard just so I had a plan B.  I did actually enjoy my time at school; especially physical education, business studies and mathematics classes.

					<h2>Uni Life</h2>
						<p class="aboutMeText">
							I chose a local university as it not only had a great reputation for my field of study but it meant I could continue playing football at the club and I could stay close to my ever growing family (my brothers had started their own families and I wanted to be around to be cool Uncle Kris).
							<br />
							<br />
							I liked playing about with technology and had enjoyed business studies at school so it seemed logical to do Business Information Systems as my degree.  It gave me a good grasp of the concept of ensuring that the technology is in place to support business services. This includes taking calculated risks with new technology, in line with the business strategy of the organisation, in order to gain competitive advantage and to let the data guide you to what the customer wants (just make sure you have good data).
							<br />
							<br />
							I ventured off to York to a placement year in 2009 at Nestle.  It was a great experience and I left with a new found appreciation of the work that goes into building and maintaining technology for a global organisation and with my pockets lined with amazingly discounted chocolate!
							<br />
							<br />
							It was back to UWE for my final year and it really was heads down as I knew my first class was within reach.  To this day I love learning new skills and so technology is a great field to be in as it continues to develop at a rapid rate.
						</p>

					<h2>Work Life</h2>
						<p class="aboutMeText">
							After graduating I went to work in the IT department at Andrews, a South West based estate agents.  I started off there building servers and focusing on learning everyday technical tasks.  After a while I asked for a new challenge and was given a role as a business analyst; mapping out all of Andrews processes and standardising them across their fifty branches (sometimes you wish you never asked).
							<br />
							<br />
							Whilst I loved the culture and responsibility I got working at a small company I had an urge to go work and shape something at a global organisation.  This led to me joining Tesco on their Technology Leadership graduate scheme in September 2012 and I have worked their ever since.
